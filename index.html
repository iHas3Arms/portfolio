            My name is James Anthony John Brennen, 
            and I would like to thank you for reading this page.
            I was born from a Romanian mother in 2009 and grew up with herself, my father - a British man - my 12-years-older brother, Ryan,
            who had a different Irish father - he unfortunately passed away when my brother was very young - and my 15-years-older sister (who's father is Romanian).
            I grew up in a town called Altrincham in the Northern city of Manchester.
            My siblings and I are all connected by our mother, however that's only a genetic way.
            We are mainly connected by our love and liking of one another.
            I have always been encouraged to do the things I enjoy and to follow my dreams,
            but also that to achieve these goals I must put time, effort, sweat and tears into them.
            Growing up with this mindset, I have so far lived a happy life, learning many skills along the way.
            I have developed great friendships, and have had them taken away.
            I have had people close to me taken away.
            When I was 7 years old, my aunt from my mother's side, Zina(Romanian name), was killed by cancer, just like both of my grandmothers.
            Through experiences like these, I have turned into a strong person who can deal with bad situations.
            However, not all of the bad experiences I've had are truly "bad". 
            In fact, a lot of my "bad" experiences are merely inconvenient situations, however
            being in these situations so many times has given me a great sense of being adaptable
            and being able to throw solutions at problems when they come.
            A great example of this is my love of programming.
            I am a self-taught programmer, and I know multiple coding/programming languages,
            including JavaScript, HTML, or <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage,
            CSS, or <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets, and C++. In fact, I coded this website myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            Being a coder/programmer, I am forced to solve issues through the power of my mind,
            as I have to first figure out what is wrong, and then come up with a solution.
            Throughout this portfolio, there will be different sections, each containing 
            information about myself or the things I do.
            Part of this is about my interest in programming, and includes projects I have made along the way, like a version of the infamous 
            Google Dinosaur Game, a recreation of the popular Snake Game, and more.
            I enjoy working with others, as
            I like helping people when they need it, and I love sharpening my skills.
            However, I am not limited to this. I can work on my own just as well, however in any situation,
            it is usually preferable to work with another person, as if one
            makes a mistake, the other can help.
            I enjoy learning and can adapt to new environments with ease.
            I can learn new skills rather quickly as I am and always have been a fast-learner.

            I have much experience with this language.
            I have used it many times, even for this website.
            I know much about it and can use it very well.
            I have created multiple things with it, including games, websites, and multiple Discord bots.
            You will find below a few basic games I have created with JavaScript.
